Hackathon Track: New France Village

How does this project fit within the track?

Credit Passport fits New France Village's "Future of Finance" track as a TradFi-to-RealFi bridge that tokenizes creditworthiness (RWA) for institutional adoption! It solves banks losing billions in revenue from creditworthy migrants by creating on-chain credit passports that fintechs and lenders can underwrite against using compliant, admin-controlled dashboards. This spans RWA (credit reputation as financial primitive), Institutional ETH (lender policy engines), Wall Street Adoption (unlocks lending revenue), and Compliance/AML (wallet-based identity + role separation), delivering real-world finance infrastructure that connects Main Street borrowers to Wall Street profitability.

Sponsor Track: ADI Foundation - Open Project Submission

How does this project fit within the track?

Credit Passport targets the idea of "reputation-based or data-driven credit system"! Deployed on ADI Chain, Credit Passport tokenizes creditworthiness (RWA) as a financial primitive for institutional underwriting, featuring lender dashboards, role-based admin controls, policy engines, and whitelabel-ready architecture. The MVP demonstrates clear real-economy impact, unlocking bank revenue from creditworthy cross-border borrowers while prioritizing institutional UX with risk monitoring, compliance controls, and extensible design for long-term regulated finance adoption on ADI's compliance-optimized infrastructure!
