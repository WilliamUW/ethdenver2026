# 🌍 **Global Credit Passport** 🌎

_Your credit score shouldn't stop at the border_

## 🚨 **Hi, I'm William from Toronto!** 🇨🇦

I graduated from **University of Waterloo**, landed a full-time SWE job in **California**, and moved with an **excellent Canadian credit score**. Paid every bill on time. Multiple cards. Perfect history.

**Then reality hit:**

- ❌ Couldn't get a **credit card**
- ❌ Had to **prepay 1 YEAR** for my phone plan (despite SWE salary!)
- ❌ Rejected for **apartments**
- ❌ Couldn't **lease a car**

**Good job, good credit, good income = invisible.** Banks saw "no US history" and slammed the door.

## 🎯 **My Mission**

**Credit Passport** makes creditworthiness **portable worldwide** 🗺️

**One wallet. One global score. No borders.**

```
🇨🇦 Canada: 720/900 ✓
🇺🇸 USA: 785/850 ✓
🇲🇽 Mexico: 820/950 ✓
➡️ Global Score: **775** ⭐
```

## ✨ **What It Does**

### **1. Credit Passport** 🛂

Paste your credit report → Parse → Save on-chain. **Unlimited countries per wallet.**

### **2. Credit Card Applications** 💳

Submit application → Admin sees your **global profile** → **Instant approve/reject**

```
👤 William: APPROVED ✅
Global Score: 775 | Countries: CA+US | Risk: Low
```

## 🔥 **Live Demo**

**[Try it →](http://localhost:3000)** _(local dev)_  
**ETHDenver:** Connect wallet → Add my Canadian profile → Apply → Watch approval! ✨

## 🏗️ **How It Works**

```
1. Paste credit report → Parse → Save to chain
2. Global engine → Normalize scales → Compute score
3. Apply for card → Admin dashboard → Decision
```

## 🎖️ **Perfect for ETHDenver + ADI**

✅ **RWA**: Credit = tokenized financial primitive  
✅ **Institutional**: Banks get underwriting API  
✅ **ADI**: Compliance-ready for regulated finance  
✅ **Real economy**: Unlocks revenue from good borrowers

## 🚀 **Run It (5 mins)**

yarn install
yarn chain    # Terminal 1
yarn deploy   # Terminal 2
yarn start    # Terminal 3
```

**Open:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 💡 **The Business Case**

```
Today: "No local score? → Decline 😞"
Tomorrow: "Global 775 + 3 countries? → APPROVE 💰"
```

**Millions of creditworthy migrants = untapped bank revenue.**

## 🏆 **Hackathon Bingo**

- ✅ **Deployed MVP**
- ✅ **Personal story** (this is MY pain!)
- ✅ **Institutional fit**
- ✅ **RWA alignment**
- ✅ **Clean UI/UX**
- ✅ **Extensible**

## 🙌 **Built With Heart**

**I lived every rejection.** Prepaying a year for a phone plan with a SWE salary? Insane.

**Good borrowers deserve credit. Banks deserve revenue. Geography shouldn't matter.**
